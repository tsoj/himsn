# Her Imperial Majesty's Space Navy

## An expansion pack for [Oolite](http://www.oolite.org/).

"A more 'believable' Navy presence that sits more comfortably in the Ooniverse as many of us see it. The problem with GN is that it's too big. Based on canon and lore, the war against the Thargoids is played out mostly in InterGalactic space, and therefore you wouldn't expect to find a big naval presence in 'normal' space. There would not be navy ships all over the place (clogging up the spacelanes!) and the idea of numerous naval bases (SecComs) in each Galaxy also seems a bit silly. These stations also skew the game quite badly due to their market economics. Also, GN often focuses on pirates, and there is no justification for this within the game - that's what the GalCop Police are for.

We are talking about an OXP which adds a much more discrete (and believable) naval presence, with a more appropriate range of ships. It may in time also offer missions similar to the two in-built missions involving HIMSN: small, covert special-ops type missions rather than the somewhat repetitive mass shoot-em-ups that GN offers.

The Navy is there if you go looking. If you do your normal trading, mining and bounty hunting you will never see them. They do not, under any circumstances, meddle in internal system politics. So, you will not be attacked by the Navy if you are an offender or even a fugitive for that matter. That is a police matter."
